# Introduction { .intro }

In this project, you will create a memory game where you have to memorise and repeat a sequence of random colours!

![screenshot](finished_screenshot.png)

# Step 1: Create a random colour sequence { .activity }

Letâ€™s generate the random sequence. We also want to make the ballerina's dress flash different colours to represent the sequence.

## Activity Checklist { .check }

+ Start a new Scratch project. Delete the cat by right clicking it and clicking **Delete**.
+ Replace the background of the stage with **Indoors/spotlight-stage**.
+ Select a main character for the game. If you really don't want a ballerina then choose something else. It doesn't have to be a person, but it needs to be able to show different colours.
+ Create 4 costumes for you sprite and edit the main colour of them using the *Fill tool* to be different.
+ Rename your character to something memorable E.g. Simone
+ In Variables *Make a list* called *sequence* *For this sprite only*

```blocks
when FLAG clicked
delete (all v) of [sequence v]
repeat (4)
    add (pick random (1) to (4)) to [sequence v]
    switch to costume (item (last v) of [sequence v]
    wait (1) secs
```

## Test Your Project { .flag }

Click the green flag.

+ Does the dress change colour 4 times?
+ Is it hard to tell when you get the same colour twice in the sequence?

## Things to try { .try }

+ Try playing a sound after each costume change, so that you can tell if it is the same colour twice in a row.

## Save your project { .save }

# Step 2: Add buttons to input the sequence guess { .activity }

Now we need to add some coloured drums so you can enter in your guess at the sequence.

## Activity Checklist { .check }

+ Import a new sprite **Things/drum2**
+ Make the sprite a bit smaller by clicking on the *Shrink sprite* icon and then on the drum several times.
+ Rename the sprite *BlueDrum*
+ Using the Fill tool again, edit the costume so that the top of the drum is blue.
+ Add the following code to send a message to Ballerina

```blocks
when [BlueDrum] clicked
broadcast [BlueClicked v]
```

+ Duplicate the drum sprite 3 times
+ Edit the colour of each drum
+ Rename each one after it's colour
+ Create a new broadcast message for each one

Now we need to return to the Ballerina sprite, and add some code to receive the messages and check our guesses.

```blocks
when I receive [BlueClicked v]
if <(item (1 v) of [sequence v])=[1]>
    delete (1 v) of [sequence v]
else
    say [Wrong!] for (1) secs
```

You will need 4 copies of this script, one for each colour message. The numbers to use to compare with the list item can be seen by looking at the Costumes, and seeing the numbers you have for each colour.

## Test Your Project { .flag }

Click the green flag.

+ Can you get the sequence right?

## Things to try { .try }

+ It is slightly too easy to remember the last colour in the sequence as the ballerina remains in that colour dress. Can you make the ballerina change to a white dress when she has finished the sequence?

## Save your project { .save }

# Step 3: Let's celebrate success { .activity }

If you get the sequence correct, it would be nice if the game did something exciting! Let's add the following script to the *Stage*

```blocks
when I receive [Won v]
play sound [Eggs v]
repeat (90)
    change [color v] effect by (25)
    wait (0.1) secs
end
clear graphic effects
```

You can see what it does by double clicking on it. Disco!

When you get tired of that excitment, let's move on. We need to create a way to detect if we've completed the sequence and broadcast the *Won* message. Add the following code to 

```blocks
when I receive [CorrectGuess v]
delete (1 v) of [sequence v]
if <(length of [sequence v])=[0]>
    broadcast [Won v]
```

And we need to edit each of the 4 receiver codes to broadcast CorrectGuess rather than delete an item from *sequence*.

```blocks
when I receive [BlueClicked v]
if <(item (1 v) of [sequence v])=[1]>
    broadcast [CorrectGuess v]
else
    say [Wrong!] for (1) secs
```
